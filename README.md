## 🐧 Linux / CachyOS Build

This project can be built for Linux as an AppImage or installed natively on Arch Linux / CachyOS.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- For Arch/CachyOS: `base-devel`, `electron32`, `asar`, `npm`, `nodejs`

### Building an AppImage

```bash
# One-step build (extracts asar, installs deps, builds):
./scripts/prepare-build.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
npm install -g @electron/asar
asar extract resources/app.asar extracted-app
cp -r extracted-app/build/obf-app build/obf-app
npm install
npm run dist:linux
```

The output will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Installing on CachyOS / Arch Linux

```bash
makepkg -si
```

This uses the system `electron32` package and installs a launcher at `/usr/bin/yihuo-etor`.

### Notes

- The app connects to a remote web UI and monitors local **Torchlight: Infinite** game logs to provide real-time tracking data.
- **Steam Proton users:** Game logs will be located under the Steam Proton compatibility path, typically:
  ```
  ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/<APP_ID>/pfx/drive_c/...
  ```
  You may need to configure the app to point to this directory.
